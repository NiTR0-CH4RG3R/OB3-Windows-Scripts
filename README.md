# Introduction
This repository contains the configuration scripts for WSO2 Open Banking 3.0.0 accelerators on Windows.

## How to use?
Copy the powershell scripts in the relevent folder to the bin directory of their respective accelerator.

> NOTE : Since these scripts are not currently signed. So you may need to bypass the execution policies in the powershell in order to run these scripts. Once these scripts are properly signed you can set your powershell execution policy to 'Remotesigned' and run these scripts without any problem. You can bypass the powershell execution policies using the following command.
>```powershell -executionpolicy bypass .\you_script.ps1```
